# Smart-Reader

Handwritten text reader that will be able to replicate equations and detect drawings.

My current plan is to develop algorithm to split words into seperate characters and than pass them to Model.<br>
I need to restructure my textReader so that model only recognites characters and data_preprocessor only send words<br>
seperated into individual characters to it.

# Smart-Reader

Handwritten text reader that will be able to replicate equations and detect drawings.

I'll be using numReader for my Univeristy project so it'll be a seperate project and after that I'll merge digits and handwritings<br>
datasets and create full text/number/equations recogintion model.<br>

I'm currently working on fixing function that prepares image for tensorflow.
